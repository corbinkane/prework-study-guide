# <Prework-Study_guide>

## Created a webpage to be used as a study guide utilizing HTTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind this assignment was to take my first steps into the field of coding and development
- This project was built to be used as a study guide during my time in the coding bootcamp as a student
- The problem this solves is now my notes are easier to find in one place and I can see how the final product will actually look
- What did you learn?I learned a lot about how the structure of the age is created and what different types of code can affect or impliment on a webpage

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
